1) What is a data structure?
--> A data structure is a systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
Example of a data structure: Arrays

2) Real life application of data structure
- stack data structure is used for redo and undo functionality

3) What is abstract data types?
--> ADTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using
functons without specifying what ia there inside the function and how the 
operations are perfomed

4) Types of data structures
--> There are 2 types of data structures
    1. Linear data structures
    2. Non linear data structures

    Linear data structures -->
        A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear
        (sequential) order
        Example: Array, Queue, Stack, Linked List
        If each element of a data structure has one predecessor and one successor
        we call it linear data structures
        let an array --> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
        2's predecessor is 1 and successor is 3
        3's predecessor is 2 and successor is 4

        1 and 7 is exception in this case
    
    Non linear data structure -->
        A data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in
        a linear (sequential) order. There is no linear arrangement of the elements.
        For example: Tree
        in tree we have one predecessor and two successor, so it's not a linear data structure.
        Another example: Graph
